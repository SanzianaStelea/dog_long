# Project on Classification of galaxies:
- Sanziana Stelea and Stefan Solomon
- This is a didactical project for accustomization with Pytorch, git, data processing
- Based on Galaxy Zoo 2 Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge
- See `Neural Network Project Presentation -Classification of Galaxies-.pdf` for other details

## Content (master branch):
- Data processing in `shaggy.ipynb`
- Network for question t01 in `scooby_doo.ipynb`
- Network for question t02 in `velma_train.ipynb` and `velma_eval.ipynb`
- Network for question t07 in `daphne.ipynb`
- Python libraries with useful classes and function in `classes.ipynb` and `lightning_class.ipynb`
- Processed data used for training in `unbalanced_t01.csv`, `t02.csv`, `t07_csv`
- Weights for trained models in `t01_unbalanced_net.pth`, `t02_net.pth`
